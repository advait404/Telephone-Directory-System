# Telephone-Directory-System
In this project, we will be designing and coding a Telephone Directory System for Asia Pacific University. The proper designing and programming practices that were taught in the lecture and tutorial classes must be applied. The program must allow the Telephone Operator (TO) to carry out the following: 

1. Searching employee’s telephone extension number by using employee’s full name or ID to search through the records file. 

3. Adding new employee records that includes the employee’s name, ID, extension number and department name, while making sure there are no duplicate entry. It must also create a 
records text file if one has not been created yet. 

3. Updating the extension number of existing employees using their name or id as the search key. 

4. Listing all the employee records and arranging them alphabetically by their department name.
